**not properly maintained**

Even though there are a lot of options to retrieve current meal plans from Karlruher dining halls, none of them are really good.
The website is not responsive enough, OpenMensa parsers are a pain and the OpenMensa app is also not good anyway.

So I made this little App that scraps data from Studierendenwerk website and saves it in Codable Models. It's not perfect but I'll work on the small issues when I have time.

Also, you're welcome to use the parser class to build something even better as long as you let me know :)
